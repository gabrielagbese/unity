// Start by creating a new Unity project and importing the necessary assets and files.

// Create a new scene and add a UI text object to display the "START THE GAME [ENTER]" message. Set its position, font size, and color as desired.

// Add a script to the car object to control its movement. Inside this script, define a boolean variable named "gameStarted" that indicates whether the game has started or not. Set this variable to false initially.

// In the Update() method of the car script, check whether gameStarted is true. If it is, allow the car to be controlled. If not, wait for the player to press the Enter key to start the game.

// Add three obstacle objects to the scene, placing them at different locations on the road.

// Use Unity's built-in random number generator to generate five different locations for the coins each time the game runs. Make sure to place the coins in locations where the car can pick them up.

// Add a script to the coin object to control its behavior. Inside this script, keep track of how many coins have been collected and update the car's speed accordingly. Also, keep track of the current location of the car and respawn it at the last coin collected if it hits an obstacle and loses a life.

// Add a UI text object to display the current number of lives. Set its position, font size, and color as desired. Update its value whenever the car loses a life.

// Add a script to the car object to keep track of the current number of lives. When the car hits an obstacle, reduce the number of lives by one and update the UI text object.

// When the player has run out of lives, end the game by displaying a "Game Over" message and stopping the car's movement.

// By following these steps, you should be able to create a basic game that meets the requirements outlined in the prompt.
